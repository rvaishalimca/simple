            <h1>Welcome to Beach</h1>
            <p>A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles. The particles can also be biological in origin, such as
                mollusc shells or coralline algae. </p>

                Beach may refer to: small systems where rock material moves onshore, offshore, or alongshore by the forces of waves and currents; or geological units of considerable size. The former are described in detail below; the larger geological
                units are discussed elsewhere under bars.

                Some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby. Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered
                beaches, are not developed in this manner. Wild beaches can be appreciated for their untouched beauty and preserved nature. Beaches typically occur in areas along the coast where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments.
